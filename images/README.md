## 💡 Usage Recommendations

### LinkedIn
Use the optimized GIFs (takeoff_optimized.gif or quick_takeoff.gif) as they're under 500KB and will load quickly. Pair with full screenshots for detailed posts.

### GitHub README
Use the higher-quality GIFs (takeoff_sequence.gif, flight_maneuvers.gif) to showcase your work in detail. The full screenshots work great for documentation.

### Portfolio Website
Mix the 1080p screenshots with optimized GIFs for fast loading times without sacrificing quality.
